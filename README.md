Program description: Docking_Profiler.py generates overview plots from a VLS-docking run with ICM, using a SDF-file containing ICM-VLS scores as input

Input requirements: An SDF file in which the first column contains molecule names and is called "NAME" and in which all other columns must only contain numerical values

The user can specify the input and output file names and a threshold value at the top of the Docking_Profiler.py script.
The parameters that are to be plotted are specified at the end of the Docking_Profiler.py script.
